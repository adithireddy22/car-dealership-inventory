# ✨ Features

## 🔐 Authentication

- User registration
- User login
- JWT access-token authentication
- Authenticated user information
- Protected application routes
- Automatic redirection to login when authentication is missing or invalid
- Logout functionality

---

## 🚘 Vehicle Management

Authenticated users can:

The system prevents purchasing vehicles when the available quantity is insufficient.

---

### Restock Vehicle

Users can increase the inventory quantity of an existing vehicle.

Example:

    Current Quantity: 4
    Restock: 3
    New Quantity: 7

Restock validation prevents invalid quantities from being submitted.

---

## 🔎 Search and Filtering

The vehicle catalog supports:

- Vehicle search
- Category filtering
- Stock availability filtering
- Combined filtering
- Dynamic inventory results

Supported vehicle categories include:

- Sedan
- SUV
- Truck
- Hatchback
- Electric
- Coupe

---

## 📝 Form Validation

Vehicle forms include validation for fields such as:

- Vehicle name
- Category
- Price
- Quantity

Authentication forms also validate required user information.

Invalid input is handled before submitting requests to the backend.

---

## ⚠️ Error Handling

The application handles common errors including:

- Invalid authentication
- Missing authentication token
- Invalid vehicle ID
- Vehicle not found
- Invalid vehicle data

# 🔐 Authentication Flow

The application uses JWT-based authentication.

    User
      ↓
    Register
      ↓
    Login
      ↓
    FastAPI validates credentials
      ↓
    JWT access token generated
      ↓
    Frontend stores authentication state
      ↓
    Protected API requests include token
      ↓
    FastAPI verifies JWT
      ↓
    Authorized request processed

Users who are not authenticated cannot access protected application functionality.

If authentication is missing or the token becomes invalid, the application redirects the user to the login page.

---

# 👤 User Authentication APIs

The authentication system provides endpoints for:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | Register a new user |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Authenticate a user and obtain JWT |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | Get the currently authenticated user |

> Exact API prefixes may vary according to the router configuration in the backend.

---

# 🚘 Vehicle API

The backend provides REST APIs for vehicle management.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/vehicles` | Get all vehicles |
| GET | `/api/vehicles/{id}` | Get a specific vehicle |
| POST | `/api/vehicles` | Add a vehicle |
| PUT | `/api/vehicles/{id}` | Update a vehicle |
| DELETE | `/api/vehicles/{id}` | Delete a vehicle |
| POST | `/api/vehicles/{id}/purchase` | Purchase vehicle quantity |
| POST | `/api/vehicles/{id}/restock` | Restock vehicle quantity |

All protected vehicle operations require valid authentication.

---
